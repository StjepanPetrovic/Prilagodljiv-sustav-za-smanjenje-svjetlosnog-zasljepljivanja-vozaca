abstract = {This paper proposes a prototype model for an automatic anti-glare system to reduce the risk of accidents during night time driving. The architecture consists of an aperture assembly and sensors. The aperture assembly is a two dimensional array of aperture elements, and their transmittances can be independently controllable. According to the transmittance, each aperture element will act either as opaque or transparent. The intensity of light ray is modulated by the transmittance of aperture elements, which causes the reduction of intensity of light passing through it. The prototype is implemented using liquid crystal display (LCD) and photovoltaic sensors. This system provides an automated mechanism to control the illumination according to the direction of incoming light. The fundamental idea is to measure the incoming light and using measured values to generate patterns on the LCD to reduce the illumination. The proposed prototype can be implemented in two ways: i) as spectacles with liquid crystal sheets placed in front of the glasses, which can be used while driving, ii) by placing large liquid crystal sheets in front of the windshields of vehicles. This method provides a flexible low cost implementation to build simple, reliable device to reduce the intensity of the light on-the-fly.},

abstract = {The anti-glare facilities in median strips are designed to block opposing headlights in order to avoid disability glare, but a large amount of headlight leakage results in uncomfortable glare, to the point that drivers can barely detect dangerous obstacles or road conditions. This paper aims to explore the glare range under high-beam headlights on drivers' visual requirements. Based on an analysis of the mechanism of headlight glare, this paper proposes a subjective headlight glare scale, and classifies glare discomfort into two categories: interference glare, and acceptability glare. Combining the scales, 24 drivers and a standard light-emitting diode automotive headlamp were used to conduct glare effect tests. The size of the laboratory that closes to scotopic vision is 12 m × 6 m. The illuminance thresholds of disability glare–interference glare (DGIG) and interference glare–acceptability glare (IGAG), along with the spatial distribution of each glare level, were collected at the longitudinal distances of 3 m, 5 m, 7 m, 10 m, and 12 m. Meanwhile, the illuminance threshold and the spatial distribution of each glare level up to a longitudinal distance of 120 m were calculated. The results indicate that disability glare is distributed in the central area, while interference glare and acceptability glare are distributed from the center to the margins. At the same longitudinal distance, the vertical illuminance of the driver's eye under the same glare level is almost equal. In the range of a longitudinal distance of 120 m, the spatial distribution of each glare level enlarges with each increase in longitudinal distance. The results can provide scientific evidence for calculating the reasonable heights of anti-glare facilities for expressways with different alignments.},

@article{P2014,
abstract = {Headlights of vehicles pose a great danger during night driving. The drivers of most vehicles use high, bright beam while driving at night. This causes a discomfort to the person travelling from the opposite direction. He experiences a sudden glare for a short period of time. This is caused due to the high intense headlight beam from the other vehicle coming towards him from the opposite direction. We are expected to dim the headlight to avoid this glare. This glare causes a temporary blindness to a person resulting in road accidents during the night. To avoid such incidents, we have fabricated a prototype of automatic headlight dimmer. This automatically switches the high beam into low beam thus reducing the glare effect by sensing the approaching vehicle. It also eliminates the requirement of manual switching by the driver which is not done at all times. The construction, working and the advantages of this prototype model is discussed in detail in this paper.},

The main purpose of this system is to present a cost-effective technique to illuminate blind spots while driving in the night and during the times when the visibility is reduced significantly to make the objects visible in those darkened locations and thereby prevent accidents. The system functions in accordance to the controlled input from microcontroller unit which drives the stepper motors connected to the headlights. The system is also designed to receive input from the indicator switch wherein a full turn is achieved by the headlight mirror when the indicator input is given. Also, the adaptive headlights are automatically switched on when the amount of light measured by a photo diode falls below a threshold, thereby eliminating the need for the driver to switch on the headlights.},

abstract = {The automotive industry is developing continuously, trying to improve, among others, the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Using modern technology, the dangers caused by weather hazards like rain, snow, fog, or glare were identified and reduced. This paper presents an anti-glare solution using existing technologies that can be found already in a high-end car like the driver's eyes tracking systems, light intensity sensors, or head-up displays. In addition to the existing elements, a sun tracking sensor is required to detect the point where the sun light has the maximum intensity on the windshield surface. Knowing the driver's position and the point on the windshield where the sunlight has a high intensity, a dark spot can be created on the windshield in order to reduce the discomfort created by glare. Depending on the intensity of the light and taking into consideration the traffic safety laws, the spot's transparency can vary between certain limits. Therefore, the dangers caused by glare will be diminished and the risks of not observing pedestrians, other traffic participants, traffic signs, or sudden curves will be considerably lower. Another advantage of using a digital sunshade based on smart glass or in-glass transparent displays, instead of a regular sunshade, is that the whole windshield can be protected against glare not just the top of it. The results were verified and highlighted using computer simulations done via a MATLAB environment.},

abstract = {After prolonged fixation, a stationary object placed in the peripheral visual field fades and disappears from our visual awareness, especially at low luminance contrast (the Troxler effect). Here, we report that similar fading can be triggered by visual transients, such as additional visual stimuli flashed near the object, apparent motion, or a brief removal of the object itself (blinking). The fading occurs even without prolonged adaptation and is time-locked to the presentation of the visual transients. Experiments show that the effect of a flashed object decreased monotonically as a function of the distance from the target object. Consistent with this result, when apparent motion, consisting of a sequence of flashes was presented between stationary disks, these target disks perceptually disappeared as if erased by the moving object. Blinking the target disk, instead of flashing an additional visual object, turned out to be sufficient to induce the fading The effect of blinking peaked around a blink duration of 80 msec. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism that controls the visibility of visual objects in a spatially selective and time-locked manner in response to transient visual inputs. Possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will be discussed.},
