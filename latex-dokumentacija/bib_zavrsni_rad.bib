@techreport{Pankaj,
abstract = {This paper proposes a prototype model for an automatic anti-glare system to reduce the risk of accidents during night time driving. The architecture consists of an aperture assembly and sensors. The aperture assembly is a two dimensional array of aperture elements, and their transmittances can be independently controllable. According to the transmittance, each aperture element will act either as opaque or transparent. The intensity of light ray is modulated by the transmittance of aperture elements, which causes the reduction of intensity of light passing through it. The prototype is implemented using liquid crystal display (LCD) and photovoltaic sensors. This system provides an automated mechanism to control the illumination according to the direction of incoming light. The fundamental idea is to measure the incoming light and using measured values to generate patterns on the LCD to reduce the illumination. The proposed prototype can be implemented in two ways: i) as spectacles with liquid crystal sheets placed in front of the glasses, which can be used while driving, ii) by placing large liquid crystal sheets in front of the windshields of vehicles. This method provides a flexible low cost implementation to build simple, reliable device to reduce the intensity of the light on-the-fly.},

@article{Kanai2003,
abstract = {After prolonged fixation, a stationary object placed in the peripheral visual field fades and disappears from our visual awareness, especially at low luminance contrast (the Troxler effect). Here, we report that similar fading can be triggered by visual transients, such as additional visual stimuli flashed near the object, apparent motion, or a brief removal of the object itself (blinking). The fading occurs even without prolonged adaptation and is time-locked to the presentation of the visual transients. Experiments show that the effect of a flashed object decreased monotonically as a function of the distance from the target object. Consistent with this result, when apparent motion, consisting of a sequence of flashes was presented between stationary disks, these target disks perceptually disappeared as if erased by the moving object. Blinking the target disk, instead of flashing an additional visual object, turned out to be sufficient to induce the fading The effect of blinking peaked around a blink duration of 80 msec. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism that controls the visibility of visual objects in a spatially selective and time-locked manner in response to transient visual inputs. Possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will be discussed.},

@article{P2014,
abstract = {Headlights of vehicles pose a great danger during night driving. The drivers of most vehicles use high, bright beam while driving at night. This causes a discomfort to the person travelling from the opposite direction. He experiences a sudden glare for a short period of time. This is caused due to the high intense headlight beam from the other vehicle coming towards him from the opposite direction. We are expected to dim the headlight to avoid this glare. This glare causes a temporary blindness to a person resulting in road accidents during the night. To avoid such incidents, we have fabricated a prototype of automatic headlight dimmer. This automatically switches the high beam into low beam thus reducing the glare effect by sensing the approaching vehicle. It also eliminates the requirement of manual switching by the driver which is not done at all times. The construction, working and the advantages of this prototype model is discussed in detail in this paper.},

abstract = {The commercial vehicles and passenger cars travelling at night times undergo fatal accidents due to the glare from the upcoming vehicles, which costs human lives and money. Thus, reducing such accidents is mandatory and thereby a solution to reduce glare at night times which can be universally applied becomes the need of the day. A system which reduces the light intensity specifically targeted towards the upcoming driver can be developed with the use of an Electrochromic film, which is a translucent material and helps in controlling the glare and ensures the adequate availability of light for visibility of the roads. By the use of a light sensor and a microcontroller the working can be automated and it can also be integrated with the Engine Control Unit. The following work provides a solution to the real-time problem existing and helps in reducing the fatal accidents at night.},
